# Wordle Phase 1
This is a copy of the Wordle game using a Wordle API to retrieve the word of the day, 
and a dictionary API to confirm guesses are legitimate words. The program takes input 
from the user for each guess, checks that it is a legal guess (five letters and an actual word)
and checks it against the Word. If it is a right letter in a right location, it prints in green. 
If it is a right letter in a wrong location, it prints in yellow. The user has six guesses to 
guess the right word.

Phase 2 is coming, which will be an automated Wordle solver.
